I graduated in May 2025 from Northeastern University with a master's degree in Public History and a graduate certificate in Digital Humanities. I have a BA ('18) from Northeastern University in Linguistics & English. I have worked as an antiquarian bookseller, historical researcher, and letterpress assistant.

My spare time is spent reading, knitting, and cross stitching. I also enjoy exploring and learning about the community and neighborhood around me. 

My research interests include the history of books, methods of community history, and historical geography. I embrace opportunities to support projects with the skills I have learned during my degree, and I am happy to try news things to make a project better.
