While working with the Boston Research Center as a research associate, I contributed heavily to the [Neighborhood Public Art project](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Neighborhood_Public_Art_in_Boston). I helped to manage the data between our internal database and Wikidata, alongside the data engineer. 

When I first joined the project, our internal database was hosted on AirTable, and my work involved regular use of the base. Eventually, we transferred the database to NocoDB, an open source alternative to AirTable. I assisted with the practical transfer and created instructive documentation for future users within BRC.

This project also required an understanding of the functionality of Wikidata and its uses as a free and accessible tool for data management. Figuring out the logic of Wikidata involved close collaboration with other BRC team members to problem solve and maintain our scholarly standards. 

My experience working with Wikidata on NPA also helped me to support my colleagues working on the [Boston Black Women Lead project](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Boston_Black_Women_Lead) by making the Wikidata portion of the project navigable.
