[This project](https://hogarthnetworks.com) uses unimodal and bimodal networks to analyze the interconnectedness of book production for the Hogarth Press, run by Leonard and Virginia Woolf.

*Hogarth Networks* was created for the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities from the [NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/) at Northeastern University.

Data was gathered from A Checklist of the Hogarth Press, 1917-1946 by J. Howard Woolmer with a history of the Press by Mary E. Gaither (Revere, PA: Woolmer Brotherson Ltd., 1986), available on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/checklistofhogar0000wool/page/30/mode/2up).

The website was built using WordPress. The networks were created using Cytoscape and are hosted in a bespoke GitHub repository.

*Certificate achieved in May 2025*
