For my research internship at the [West End Museum](https://thewestendmuseum.org/), I developed a walking tour called Faces & Places: LEGBTQ+ History in the West End. I led the walking tour in August 2024 for an audience of about 40 attendees. I also gave a modified version of the tour at a Zoom event in partnership with [The History Project](https://historyproject.org/).

This project had multiple digital component parts, which are linked below.

I wrote four digital essays for the WEM Weekly newsletter.
- [Prescott Townsend](https://thewestendmuseum.org/history/era/immigrant-neighborhood/prescott-townsend/)
- [F. O. Matthiessen](https://thewestendmuseum.org/history/era/immigrant-neighborhood/f-o-matthiessen/)
- [Boston Marriages](https://thewestendmuseum.org/history/era/immigrant-neighborhood/boston-marriages/)
- [F. Holland Day](https://thewestendmuseum.org/history/era/immigrant-neighborhood/f-holland-day/)

I also created a [self-guided version of the tour](https://thewestendmuseum.org/history/era/west-boston/faces-places-lgbtq-history-in-the-west-end/) that includes a stop for each of the essays above and additional short essays for four further locations.

The [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAAnYmj49vk&t=2s) of the shortened Zoom version of the tour is also available to watch on The History Project's YouTube page.
