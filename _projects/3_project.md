I wrote this [digital essay](https://toi-field-trips.leventhal.center/locations/chocolate-mill) to support the Leventhal Map & Education Center's current exhibit, [Terrains of Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/). This exhibit explores the question of why the American Revolution began in the city of Boston.

The essay was the final project for HIST7250: Practicum in the Place-based Museum, taught by Dr. Garrett Dash Nelson at Northeastern University.

Local chocolate mills in the Revolutionary Era provided an opportunity to explore Boston's links to the Atlantic Slave Trade, through trade of goods cultivated in the Caribbean and enslavement in the city itself.

In addition to the digital skills exemplified in [my other essay for this class](https://eslbeckman.github.io/portfolio/2_project/), this essay also includes two [panel-truck](https://github.com/bplmaps/panel-truck?tab=readme-ov-file) storylines that I created to explore Revolutionary-era maps.
