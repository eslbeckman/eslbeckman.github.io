I contributed this [digital essay](https://walktothesea.com/locations/long-wharf) for the Long Wharf stop on the Walk to the Sea walking tour. 

It was written as a student project for HIST7250: Practicum in the Place-based Museum, a graduate course I took at Northeastern University with Dr. Garrett Dash Nelson, president and curator of the [Leventhal Map & Education Center](https://www.leventhalmap.org).

Writing this essay involved in-depth research in newspaper archives and exploring the practice of telling place-based history. I also developed digital skills, using Markdown to format the essay and contributing to a GitHub repository to post the essay on the website.
