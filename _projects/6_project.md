My first task when I began working at [Huskiana Press](https://huskianapress.sites.northeastern.edu/) - an essential first task for new press assistants anywhere - was sorting a new font into an empty drawer. The director of the press, Dr. Jessica Linker, had recently purchased several boxes of Sans Serif Light, which included accents for multiple different languages. 

For my major press project, I put together a composition of [Soneto XVII by Pablo Neruda](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49236/one-hundred-love-sonnets-xvii) in Spanish using Sans Serif Light. I set the type, took proofs, designed the layout, and locked up the form. Then I set it into our 1890s Golding press and registered it for printing. We used the composition for a Valentine’s Day event where I was able to teach newcomers how to operate the press so they could take a copy for themselves.

I relished my hours of sorting type in the press, and I’m grateful for this job because managing inks and solvents gave me a new understanding of responsibility and time management. And it was always a fun place to work!
